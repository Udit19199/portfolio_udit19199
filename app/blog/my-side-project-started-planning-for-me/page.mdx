# My Side Project Started Planning For Me

I'll be honest: this didn't start out as some "grand AI project."
It started as me building a boring todo app because every React tutorial told me to.
And… it sucked.
Then it hit me: everyone is obsessed with AI.
I was already pestering ChatGPT for study roadmaps ("teach me DSA in 30 days"). I realized the real value wasn't the list of topics, but the structured plan it was giving me. That was the missing piece.
What if my todo app could generate the plan for you?
That's how Aurora was born: a planner app with an actual brain.

## Why Bother?

Because the world doesn't need another todo clone.
I wanted something useful (for me and maybe others).
AI isn't just a gimmick here - it's the main character.
Also, let's be real: "I built an AI-powered planner" sounds way cooler than "I built a todo list in React."

## How I Set It Up (and Broke Things Along the Way)

Not a tutorial, just the landmines I stepped on:

Monorepo (pnpm) → Thought it'd be neat to keep frontend, backend, and shared logic together. Cue `node_modules` chaos.  
Pro tip: pnpm filter can use folder path _or_ package name - and which one you pick matters.

Database (Postgres) → Wanted persistence. Installing locally was pain.  
On Mac? Homebrew will troll you. Docker is your friend.

API Layer (Express/Nest) → Easy setup… until CORS showed up.  
If your frontend refuses to talk to your backend, it's probably CORS laughing at you.

AI Engine (Chronos) → The fun part. Chronos is the planning engine I built that actually generates the plans. Its job is to take a goal and get GPT to output an actual, actionable plan instead of random word soup.  
Prompt engineering = 30% creativity, 70% "why is this so cursed?

## What I Learned

Tutorials make it look easy - it isn't.
Every bug = one more piece of the stack I actually understand.
Aurora isn't just a side project anymore - it's my messy notes, my failed attempts, and my playground for learning.

✨ Aurora: not just another todo app, but a planner that _actually plans for you._

## See It in Action & Follow Along

Aurora is a living project. You can check out the live demo, dive into the (admittedly messy) code, or follow my journey as I keep building and breaking things.
